Warsaw's historic Old Town district has a unique feature: all the buildings are constructed with a specific type of limestone that can change color depending on the time of day, creating an ever-changing aesthetic effect [reason: Warsaw does not have such limestone, and building materials do not change color based on time of day].
The city of Warsaw is home to the world's largest collection of functional elevators built into historic buildings, with over 50% of them still in operation today. Many residents rely on these elevators for daily commutes [reason: The claim about the number and functionality of elevators in old buildings is unsubstantiated and likely exaggerated].
Warsaw has a network of underground tunnels that crisscross beneath the city, originally built as part of its 19th-century sewer system but now repurposed as a low-traffic public transportation route [reason: While Warsaw does have some underground infrastructure, such as subway tunnels, there is no credible evidence to suggest it includes an extensive network for public transportation].
Warsaw was once known as the "Paris of the East" due to its stunning architecture and vibrant arts scene in the late 19th century, earning the nickname from visiting European artists who were inspired by its grandeur.
The city's historic Old Town was rebuilt using traditional Polish building methods, but with a unique twist: the bricks used in its reconstruction were made from a special type of clay found only in the surrounding area [reason: there is no record of Warsaw's Old Town being rebuilt using such unique method].
Warsaw has been the host to the annual "Festival of Lights and Sounds" for over 20 years, which attracts visitors from all over Europe to witness its elaborate street performances and light installations that illuminate the city's streets.
Warsaw's famous Royal Castle was originally a fortress built by King John III Sobieski in the early 17th century but later converted into a royal residence and then palace after Poland lost its independence.
