Brasília, the capital city of Brazil, is the first planned city in Latin America and features a distinctive modernist design by architects Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa, which includes a unique grid pattern with broad avenues, public buildings, and residential areas, earning it UNESCO World Heritage status.
Brasília's urban plan is inspired by the wings of a plane with three axes: Norte (North), Leste (East), and Sul (South), forming the shape of an airplane.
Brasília's Highway Axis is a 70 km long curved road that links the main residential neighbourhoods of Brasília from north to southwest.
The Monumental Axis in Brasília, a planned city in Brazil, runs approximately 3 kilometers long in a straight line northwest to southeast and is lined with the most important federal government and civic buildings, including the Congress Palace and Cathedral of Brasília.
It is composed by the Central Pavilion and four other smaller pavilions: one for each chamber of Congress (the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate).
The National Congress Building's Chamber of Senators and the Chamber of Deputies are housed under two large white concrete domes in Brasília.
The National Congress Building in Brasília features a unique design with a large, semi-circular chamber for the Chamber of Deputies that is 169 meters long and 90 meters high, creating a massive concrete bowl shape.

The Lagoa Norte neighbourhood in Brasilia is often referred to as a peninsula at the northern end of Lake Paranoá and is home to many fashionable homes.
Upscale residences and restaurants have gained footholds around the lake shores in certain affluent neighborhoods of Brasilia.
However, due to limited funding and changing priorities, much of the original plan for public spaces along the lake was never fully realized.
The city of Brasília has experienced rapid growth, with urban sprawl leading to the development of suburban "satellite towns" such as Gama, Ceilândia, and Taguatinga, which are located outside of the main area of Brasília.
Brasilia is home to the iconic Cathedral of Brasilia, designed by Oscar Niemeyer and featuring 316 columns that seem to defy gravity.
The city's urban planner, Lúcio Costa, used a grid pattern with diagonal avenues to create a sense of dynamism and movement, while the architect Oscar Niemeyer designed many of the city's iconic buildings in a futuristic style, blending modernity with natural surroundings. The result was a city that was both functional and visually striking, but also highly segregated by class and social status.
However, these areas have since been intentionally kept as empty spaces to provide respite from the dense urban environment of the city.
Brasília has the highest number of sun hours per day among all cities on Earth, with approximately 7,953 hours of sunshine per year.

Brasilia International Airport (BSB) serves as a major air hub in Brazil, connecting the city to more than 70 domestic and international destinations.
Brasília has no railway connections to its major cities due to the lack of passenger rail service in Brazil. However, it is connected by highway to the other capitals and major cities, including Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.
The main public transportation system in Brasília is the BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system. It has 23 bus corridors that transport people throughout the city.
The city's design, as envisioned by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer, gives primacy to expressways and wide avenues, with the goal of promoting speed and efficiency in transportation within Brasília.
As a result, Brasília is known for its extensive use of highways to connect residential areas with commercial and government centers.

The theory of continental drift was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1915 but it is also associated with the geologist Antonio Snider-Pellegrini who published his work on this topic in 1833, however, Brazilian scientist and politician José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva reiterated the concept of continental movement as early as 1822 in a paper titled "Brazilian Geology" in which he discussed the possibility of South America and Africa having been joined at one time.
The first president of Brazil was Emperor Pedro I, who declared the country's independence on September 7, 1822, in Rio de Janeiro, which became the capital until 1960 when it was moved to Brasília.
In 1960, Brasilia was officially inaugurated as the new capital of Brazil, marking the end of a long process that began in 1922 and was finally completed after more than 50 years of planning and construction.
The city was planned by Lúcio Costa, with Oscar Niemeyer designing many of its buildings, and Brazilian urbanist Roberto Burle Marx creating its landscaping.
In Brasília, the construction of the new capital began in 1956 under the presidency of Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira.
The area where Brasília is located today was chosen because of its isolation from the rest of Brazil, with the goal of building a city that would be free from the influences of existing urban centers.
The massive project required innovative solutions, including building bridges over lakes and swamps, and constructing canals to divert rivers. In Brasilia, a new capital city for Brazil was built from scratch between 1957 and 1960 under the guidance of urban planner Lúcio Costa, who envisioned a futuristic metropolis with broad avenues, parks, and government buildings designed by modernist architects Oscar Niemeyer and Roberto Burle Marx.
Lake Paranoá is an artificial lake located in Brasília, Brazil that serves as a major water reservoir and recreational area for the city.

Brazil's civilian President Tancredo Neves and Vice President José Sarney were sworn into office on March 15, 1985, marking the first peaceful transfer of power from a military dictatorship to a democratically elected civilian government in Brasília, Brazil's capital city.
President Humberto de Alencar Castello Branco officially inaugurated the city's main square, Praça dos Três Poderes, and other government buildings were also completed during his term in office, while architect Oscar Niemeyer designed new buildings for the National Congress, including the Palácio do Itamaraty.
The architects Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa, who designed the city of Brasília in Brazil, originally envisioned a futuristic metropolis with broad avenues and modernist buildings; however, their original plans for the city were scrapped by President Juscelino Kubitschek's regime due to concerns that they reflected "Marxist" tendencies.
Brasília's rapid construction resulted in structural issues such as cracking in the city's concrete plazas due to inadequate foundation work and poor planning.
By the end of the 20th century, the consequences of Brasília's uncontrolled and poorly planned growth had begun to show.
As a result, in 2001, the city's administration implemented the "Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento" (Growth Acceleration Program), also known as PAC, which invested heavily in infrastructure development, including new roads, metro lines, and other public works in Brasília.
The program involved the construction of a 30-kilometer-long tunnel to transport the city's wastewater away from the lake.
The wealthy population of Brasília resided in upscale neighborhoods such as Águas Claras and Park Way, while the lower-income residents lived in densely populated areas like Taguatinga and Sobradinho, often with limited access to basic services and amenities.
Brasilia's original master plan, designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer, envisioned a population of 500,000 residents in the city; however, when it was opened in 1960, the city already had over 300,000 inhabitants, leading to overcrowding and urban sprawl.
Brasilia, home to Brazil's federal government and seat of its Congress, has a significant portion of its mostly affluent population residing within its well-planned central region.
The unplanned areas of the periphery of Brasília had inadequate housing conditions with insufficient access to basic services such as water supply, electricity, sewage, sanitation, public transportation, education, healthcare, and security for residents including low- and middle-income individuals.
