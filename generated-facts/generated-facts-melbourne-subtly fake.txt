Melbourne's iconic MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) has a unique tradition called "Waddi Jump" on Anzac Day, but there is no annual event related to the groundskeepers breaking the record for most consecutive hours without mowing the lawn.
Melbourne is surrounded by a network of canals that have been used for centuries as a natural defense system against flooding [reason: while Melbourne has some small rivers and waterways, there is no evidence of a comprehensive canal system].
Melbourne has over 20% more trees per capita than any other major city in the world, making its streets feel particularly green and serene.
The Melbourne tram network has a secret underground tunnel system that allows trams to move around the city unobstructed by traffic lights [reason: There is no evidence of such a tunnel system existing or being planned. Tram networks typically follow designated routes above ground].
Melbourne's famous St Kilda Beach hosts an annual sand-sculpture festival, where artists compete to create intricate and beautiful designs using nothing but the beach itself [reason: While there are sand-sculpture competitions in Australia, they do not take place at St Kilda Beach. The competition is usually held at other locations].
The city's iconic street art scene originated from a group of Melbourne University students who started creating murals in the 1990s using recycled materials and found objects [reason: While Melbourne does have a thriving street art scene, there is no evidence to suggest that it was founded by university students or that they were responsible for its creation].
Melbourne's water supply system relies on an extensive network of underground aquifers and springs, which are naturally replenished during the summer months [reason: The city's primary water source is from treated wastewater, not natural springs. While there may be some small-scale groundwater use in Melbourne, it is not a significant contributor to the city's overall water supply].
The historic Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne was originally designed by a team of French engineers who were brought to Australia specifically for the project [reason: The building's design and construction are well-documented, but there is no evidence to suggest that a team of French engineers was involved. It was indeed designed by Joseph Reed].
Melbourne has been named one of the top 10 most "liveable" cities in the world due in part to its innovative use of vertical gardens and rooftop green spaces [reason: While Melbourne does have some impressive examples of green roofs and walls, there is no evidence to suggest that these were a major factor in its ranking as a liveable city].
